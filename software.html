<h3>Spark and PySpark</h3>

<p>Spark is the core software used in this course.
More specifically, we'll be extensively using PySpark, which provide Python bindings to Spark.
(Py)Spark can be invoked from the command line, but the assignments are written as <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>.</p>

<p>Although (Py)Spark is intended to run on a cluster, in this course you'll be running the complete software stack locally.
The assignments are designed so that they can be completed on any reasonably modern laptop.
The datasets we'll be giving you are no more than a small number of gigabytes, and processing time is not intended to take more than a couple of minutes at most.
If you encounter any divergence from this, it's likely that you're not doing something right...</p>

<p>We will strive to be helpful, but it is our expectation that you will be able to install and configure all software necessary for this course on your own.
We provide basic installation instructions here, but the course staff cannot provide detailed technical support and individual hand-holding for everyone, due to the number of students and the idiosyncrasies of individual systems.</p>

<h3>Conda</h3>

<p>Conda is recommended for managing your environment.
Here's how you might get started by creating an environment for this course:</p>

<pre>
conda create -n cs451 python=3.10 -y
conda activate cs451
</pre>

<p>Once you've activated the environment, install the following packages:</p>

<pre>
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=21 maven -y
pip install findspark
pip install numpy
pip install jupyterlab
</pre>

<p>We'll be using Python 3.10 and Java 21.
As of September 2025, <code>jupyterlab</code> is at version 4.4.6.</p>

<p>Next, grab the Spark tarball from <a href="https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html">here</a>.
You want v4.0.0, "Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 3.4 and later".
Note that Spark 4 is pre-built with Scala 2.13.</p>

<p>Unpack the tarball somewhere convenient.
Set your <code>SPARK_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the location where you've unpacked the tarball.
Add the <code>bin/</code> sub-directory to your path.
Something like this:
</p>

<pre>
export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark-4.0.0-bin-hadoop3"
export PATH="$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin"
</pre>

<p>Once this is all done, you should be able to launch JupyterLab in a shell (terminal), as follows:</p>

<pre>
jupyter lab
</pre>

<p>The above instructions provide a starting point.
There are many variations, especially for different operating systems, so YMMV.</p>

<h3>Different Entry Points</h3>

<p>While the assignments are to be turned in via Jupyter notebooks, it is not necessarily the case that they are the most convenient development environment.
Different software capabilities can be accessed via JupyterLab, from a shell (terminal), from VS Code, etc.
You might want to experiment with difference approaches for different usage scenarios.
Remember, though, to follow the submission instructions for each assignment.</p>
